A simple FiveM script which causes "shift punching" to consume a configurable amount of stamina and require a configurable minimum amount of stamina to perform, with an optional configurable chance for players to fall over (ragdoll) when attempting to "shift punch" if their stamina is too low.

Additional weapons can be added to the config for detection regarding "shift punching", such as the brass knuckles.

**Note:** Players *will* still be able to throw an initial "running punch" to initiate a fight (this, I think, is still a valuable part of some players' RP when it comes to starting fights or catching up to a fleeing foe) before the stamina checks come into play. Players must regain their stamina over the minimum threshold before they will be granted another "running punch".
